Some programs may become corrupted or exhibit logical operation errors during use. These issues can lead to high processor usage problems.
Resolving these issues is not straightforward, as each individual's computer operates in different system environments, leading to varying causes of 100% CPU usage. There will be no tutorial or IT expert on the Internet that can definitively solve the problem you are facing.

"100 CPU" will help you monitor and identify the root cause of why a program is experiencing high CPU consumption. From there, you will have a foundation to seek solutions for the specific issue you are facing.

### How to use "100 CPU":
